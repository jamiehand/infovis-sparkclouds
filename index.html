<h2>What is a SparkCloud?</h2>
<p>
  A SparkCloud is a tag cloud with spark lines incorporated along with
  each word. It was a result of Microsoft Research conducted by four women,
  namely: Bongshin Lee, Nathalie Henry Riche, Amy K. Karlson, and  Sheelagh
  Carpendale. The purpose of SparkClouds is to let people see how tag clouds
  change over time.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>
    SparkClouds, like all other visualizations, have pros and cons.
    <h3>Pros</h3>
    They let users compare multiple tag clouds without having to see them separately.
    They make it convenient to see how text samples change over time.
    SparkClouds make the visualization compact and less cluttered compared to
    alternatives. Scrolling is usually not necessary, and everything can be made to fit onto
    one screen.
    Identifying words is fast, and users can easily get a big picture of the data without interaction.
    Finally, color could also be used in the visualization to encode other things.
    <h3>Cons</h3>
    The lack of x-axis labels forces
    users to guess which time period (e.g. month) is represented.
    The y-axis is normalized for each word, which makes it difficult to compare
    frequency between words (except by size of word, which is less precise).
    The position of a text on the screen means nothing, which means we're
    using the most powerful visual variable without it conveying anything meaningful.
    Furthermore, long words inevitably get more attention than short words of the same
    frequency, which might give a slightly wrong
    impression about the data.
    Accessing details in the data would require interaction. Finally,
    SparkClouds are a very specific type of visualization, which can only be
    used for word-based or tag-based datasets.
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    While SparkClouds are good for seeing trends in a tag-based dataset over time,
    they're not great for diving into details about the dataset. One particular
    example of when SparkClouds would
    be very useful is comparing State of the Union addresses over the years and
    seeing how the most frequently used words have changed over time. This
    gives us a big picture of how the
    speeches might have changed to reflect time era, presidents and policies.
